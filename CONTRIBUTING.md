## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Bug reports are absolutely necessary to keep the project alive. When you are
creating a bug report, please provide as many details as possible.

### Suggesting New Features

You are more than welcome to submit ideas for new features and enhancements
through the bug tracker, just include as many details as you can, including
potential implementation options.

### Improving the Documentation

Documentation is always a work-in-progress. Doxygen and Sphinx are the tools we
use to produce the official documentation. We also have a Wiki (in need of some
love!):

- See [docs.tizonia.org](https://docs.tizonia.org/) for the project's official documentation.
- The [Wiki](https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/wiki) may also
contain some useful information (although in need of an update).

Here there is a tutorial that will get you going quickly with the documentation
processes:

- [https://docs.tizonia.org/development/documenting.html](https://docs.tizonia.org/development/documenting.html)

### Contributing with Code

Tizonia has a hybrid codebase with some modules written in C, other written in
C++ and some other written in Python. There are also various tools that are
written in Bash and Perl.

<script type='text/javascript' src='https://www.openhub.net/p/tizonia/widgets/project_languages?format=js'></script>

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through the `good-first-issue`
or `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good first issues][good-first-issues] - issues which should only require a few lines of code.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issue` issues.

There are also a good number of proposed features that should be quite fun for
someone looking for a challenge:
* [Enhancements][enhancement] - Newly proposed features and other improvements.

Have a look at the [project's components](PROJECT.md), and follow the
instructions to build and run the codebase locally.
- [Build Tizonia from source (with Meson) (RECOMMENDED)](BUILDING_with_meson.md).
- [Build Tizonia from source (with Autotools)](BUILDING.md).

[help-wanted]:https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/issues?q=os+x+label%3A%22help+wanted%22
[enhancement]:https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement

And of course, don't hesitate to ask!.

### Spreading the Word

Do you use Tizonia and have fun with it?. Do you enjoy listening to your music
easily and without fuss, directly from your command-line? Then why not
spreading the word among colleagues and friends.

Or simply starring any of the repositories in the Tizonia
[organization](https://github.com/tizonia) would be a good way of showing your
appreciation.
