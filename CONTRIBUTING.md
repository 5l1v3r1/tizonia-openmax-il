## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Bug reports are absolutely necessary to keep the project alive. When you are
creating a bug report, please provide as many details as possible.

### Suggesting New Features

You are more than welcome to submit ideas for new features and enhancements,
just include as many details as you can, including potential implementation
options.

### Improving the Documentation

The documentation is always in need of improvement. We use Doxygen to document
that APIs and and Sphinx to produce our manuals and to give everything a nicer
look.

TODO(doc instructions here)


### Contributing with Code

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through the `good-first-issue`
or `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good first issues][good-first-issues] - issues which should only require a few lines of code.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issue` issues.

## Code Contributions

Have a look at the [project's components](PROJECT.md), and follow the
instructions on how to build the code
- [Build Tizonia from source (with Autotools)](BUILDING.md).
- [Build Tizonia from source (with Meson)](BUILDING_with_meson.md).
