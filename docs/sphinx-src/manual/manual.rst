User Guide
==========

Tizonia puts the emphasis on the music listening experience, by adhering to a
few principles:

**Command-line is the simplest UI**
  Because the keyboard is faster than
  the mouse you get to listen to your music in less time.

**Play the music, not matter what**
  Tizonia uses approximate string matching techniques to match your
  search keywords against the data provided by the streaming
  services. And 'Feeling Lucky' guesses for when no results are returned.

**Music never stops**
  Tizonia only mode of operation for its play queue is **looped**
  mode. Tizonia does not currently provide non-looped playback.

**Limit the distractions**
  No fast-forward or rewind. Only skip to
  next/previous track. No fancy 'ncurses' CLI interface to get
  distracted with. Only some track info and a visual progress bar.

**Reduce 'muscle-memory'**
  Finding the music that you want and listening to it should (the majority of the time)
  require only one command-line option on the console. E.g.:
  ``tizonia --spotify-album "Islands"``
