.. Tizonia documentation


Requirements
============

A relatively recent version of Debian or Ubuntu Linux (14.04+) should
suffice. The most up-to-date list of libraries required to build and run
Tizonia are listed in `project's main repo at GitHub
<https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il>`_.
